          this is designed as the music player of
          <a href="https://github.com/btmxh/nrs-impl">nrs</a>
          (see 
          <a href="https://github.com/btmxh/nrs-impl/issues/97">here</a>
          for context), but one can use it as a general purpose media player
        </p>

          inspired by
          <a href="https://github.com/calzoneman/sync">cy.tube</a>
          (thanks <i>/vt/</i> for introducing me to this),
          one can consider this to be a less bloated version of that
